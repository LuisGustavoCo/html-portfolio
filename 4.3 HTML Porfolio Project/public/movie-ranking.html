<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 of all-time.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Love all the things about this movie, the direction, scenes and the story.</p>

<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>The mix of 2 things that work: Simple and well-done by the Director. </p>

<h3>Seven</h3>
<p>Brad Pitt + Morgan Freeman, being directed by David Fincher... Should be unfair.</p>
